## Car Assurance Management System

**Overview**

This program is a console-based Car Assurance management system developped in C++. Each client record includes realistic personal and insurance-related fields, such as name, age, contact information, car value, accident history, license suspensions, and policy type. The system calculates risk, trust scores, and monthly premiums based on these parameters.

Clients are stored in a BST (Binary Search Tree), maintained in sorted order by client_id.
Sorting ensures clients are kept in ascending order by their unique IDs, enabling efficient search operations.

**Realistic Client Data**

Each client record contains fields such as:

*Personal details*: name, age, phone number, address.<br>
*Insurance details*: policy type (Basic, Premium, Gold), car value. <br>
*Accident history*: number of accidents due to the client, accidents not due to the client.
License suspensions count.<br>

These fields impact the computation of risk scores, trust scores, and monthly premiums.

**Dynamic Calculations**

*Risk Score*: Calculated from client details, including car value, accidents, and suspensions.<br>
*Trust Score*: Evaluates client reliability based on accident history, suspensions, policy type, and computed risk.<br>
*Monthly Premium*: Determined by combining risk and trust scores, policy type, and a base fee.<br>

**Data Validation**

Inputs are validated to ensure realistic and non-negative values (e.g., client age â‰¥ 18, non-negative accident counts).
Operations via Console Menu

*Show All Clients*: Displays all clients sorted by client_id.<br>
*Add New Client*: Prompts user for new client information, ensuring a unique client_id.<br>
*Retrieve Client*: Searches for and displays details of a client by their ID.<br>
*Update Client*: Allows partial updates to a client's details.<br>
*Remove Client*: Deletes a client record from the system.<br>
*Recompute All Scores*: Recalculates risk, trust scores, and monthly premiums for all clients based on the latest data.<br>

  <summary>How to use</summary>

    Clone or Download the Repository
    Ensure you have the following files in a single folder:

    incl.h
    struct.cpp
    main.cpp
    Create a New Console Application Project

    Open Visual Studio 2022.
    Select File > New > Project....
    Choose Console App under the C++ section and click Next.
    Name your project and choose a location, then click Create.
    Add Existing Files to the Project

    In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the project name.
    Choose Add > Existing Item....
    Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded files.
    Select incl.h, struct.cpp, and main.cpp, then click Add.
    Verify Project Settings

    Ensure that all three files (incl.h, struct.cpp, and main.cpp) are visible under the project in the Solution Explorer.
    Confirm that the project uses at least the C++11 standard (which is generally the default for Visual Studio 2022).
    Build the Project

    Click on Build > Build Solution in the menu bar, or press Ctrl+Shift+B.
    Check the Output window for any compilation errors. All files should compile without errors.
    Run the Application

    After a successful build, run the program by selecting Debug > Start Without Debugging from the menu, or by pressing Ctrl+F5.
    A console window should appear displaying the menu for the Car Assurance Management System.
    Interact with the System

    Use the console menu to add, retrieve, update, or remove clients, as well as to display all clients or recompute scores.
    Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the required information.
    Formulas and Calculations
    Risk Score: Factors in car value, driver's age, at-fault accidents, license suspensions, and other risk influencers.
    Trust Score: Rewards not-at-fault accidents, penalizes at-fault accidents and suspensions, adjusts for policy type, and reduces by half the risk score.
    Monthly Premium: Starts with a base fee, increases with higher risk, provides discounts for higher trust scores, and adjusts based on policy type.
    Note: The formulas used for computation are examples!
